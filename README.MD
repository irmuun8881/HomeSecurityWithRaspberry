## Requirements

### Hardware
**Raspberry Pi** or **small computer** alike.  
**Camera Module**  
**WIFI** or **Ethernet Cable**    
**MicroSD Card** - for the Raspberry PI OS  
**Power Supply**: Recommended to have a proper power supply for a decent performance.  
**HDMI cable** and **monitor** for initial setup. Later on, the Raspberry Pi device could be remotely controlled using **Real VNC Viewer**.    
**Case:**  An enclosure to protect Raspberry and its components  
  
  
## Software
