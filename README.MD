# Smart Home Security System using Raspberry Pi
This project is built using Raspberry Pi model 3b+ object detection such as OpenCV. The frontal face and Full body haar cascade classifier are used as pre-trained data.

## Requirements

### Hardware
**Raspberry Pi** or **small computer** alike.  
**Camera Module**  
**WIFI** or **Ethernet Cable**    
**MicroSD Card** - for the Raspberry PI OS  
**Power Supply**: Recommended to have a proper power supply for a decent performance.  
**HDMI cable** and **monitor** for initial setup. Later on, the Raspberry Pi device could be remotely controlled using **Real VNC Viewer**.    
**Case:**  An enclosure to protect Raspberry and its components  
  
  
## Software
**Raspberry Pi OS:** Install the latest version of the Raspberry PI operating system on the MicroSD card.
**Python:** Programming language that is used for writing scripts.
**OpenCV:** Open source computer vision library that is intended to perform face recognition, full body detection and image processing.
**Pre-trained data:** _Haar Cascade_ classifiers are used as pre-trained data
**Notification Service:** A service to send notifications. Python library like **_smtplib_** for email notifications or dedicative services like **_Pushbullet_** or **_Twilio_** for push notifications.
